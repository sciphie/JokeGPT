The word \"problems\" is being used in two different ways: as a mathematical term (referring to mathematical exercises) and as an idiomatic expression (referring to difficulties or challenges in life). The joke is that the math book is \"sad\" because it has a lot of mathematical exercises, which are referred to as \"problems\", but in this context, the word \"problems\" is also being used to suggest that the book is overwhelmed or unhappy. The humor comes from the pun, or the play on words.\n",
