The word \"problems\" can refer to both mathematical problems, which are exercises to solve, and emotional problems, which can make someone sad.

By saying that the math book had too many \"problems\", the joke is also implying that the book was overwhelmed or upset by the large number of mathematical exercises it contained. This creates a humorous contrast between the ordinary use of the word \"problems\" and its technical meaning in mathematics, making the joke funny.\\n\\n',\n",
